#### 5 pin R/A pogo female

The 5-pin female right angle (R/A) pogo ("loaded spring") connector is difficult to find. I ordered a set via [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com) from [RIPZV](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003579709688.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.0.0.25eff19cQIoJ01). The only other source I could find was from another Chinese producer [Jiatel](https://www.jiatel.com/product/2-5mm-pitch-5pin-right-angle-female-target-connector-pogo-connector/) that sell male and female right angle pogo pins in male+female pairs. But from them you have to inquire and then order.

#### NIR LED (Osram)

Latest genration of [Osram NIR LED](https://www.osram.com/ecat/OSLONÂ®%20P1616%20SFH%204737/com/en/class_pim_web_catalog_103489/prd_pim_device_10751075/), available from [Farnell.se](https://se.farnell.com/w/search/prl/resultat?st=SFH%204737&scope=partnumberlookahead&searchref=searchlookahead). I have a bunch of an [earlier generation  Osram NIR LED](https://se.farnell.com/osram-opto-semiconductors/sfh-4735/infrared-emitter-1050-nm-smd/dp/2981794?ICID=I-HP-STM7REC-RP-2); they will do with the same surface mount for the test series (see [datasheet](https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2711902.pdf)).

#### White LED

Looking for a surface mounted bright white LED with approximately the same surface mount as the NIR LED, I settled for a Luminus Decives 3V, 60mA LED available from [Digi-key](https://www.digikey.se/sv/products/detail/luminus-devices-inc/MP-2016-1100-40-80/4807631?s=N4IgTCBcDaIIxjgFgLQISsKByAREAugL5A).

#### Xenon bulb (Conrad)

[Conrad](https://www.conrad.se) offers an optoelectrical bi-pin [xenon bulb](https://www.conrad.se/p/xenonlampa-260-v-156-w-sockel-bi-pin-127-mm-na-1590355-tru-components-1-st-1590355). It used to be available in different version, including one with 3v and 0.9 W. This is the one I prefer but we need to find an alternative supplier or change to the 2.6volt version now available.

#### Blue laser (Sony)

Other solutions using miniature spectral sensors have relied on a Sony Blue laser at 405 nm. The particular laser is available from [Civillaser](https://www.civillaser.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=78), and also from [GroupGets](), that also sell a complete spectrometer with this SONY laser integrated.
