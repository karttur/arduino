### Introduction

This post is a manual for setting up a python interface to xSpectreÂ´s spectrometer v0.78. This post was inspired by the article [Using Python and an Arduino to Read a Sensor](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/python-arduino-potentiometer.html) by Peter Kazarinoff.

### Prerequisit

The post assumes that you have installed <span class='app'>Arduino IDE</span> and [<span class='app'>Anaconda</span>](https://karttur.github.io/setup-ide/setup-ide/install-anaconda/). The latter for creating a virtual python environment. You must of course also have access to xSpectre's spectrometer version 0.78.

### Virtual python environment

Start by creating a [virtual python environment]().

<span class='terminal'>conda create -y -n arduino python=3.8 --no-default-packages</span>

Active the _arduino_ enviroment:

<span class='terminal'>conda activate arduino</span>

Install the following packages; <span class='package'>pyserial</span>, <span class='package'>numpy</span> and <span class='package'>matplotlib</span>:

<span class='terminal'>conda install pyserial</span>

<span class='terminal'>conda install numpy</span>

<span class='terminal'>conda install matplotlib</span>

### Connecting AMS 6 channel spectrometer breakout boards

To get started, let us make an Arduino code and a python script for reading the spectral signal for [AMS 6-band spectrometer](https://karttur.github.io/arduino/module/module-AS726X-spectrometer/). This can be mounted as an external sensor using xSpectre's [spectrometer GX connection](../../spectrolum/spectrolum-v078-J3-GX-connections).

#### Arduino code

The Arduino code for the AMS 6-channel breakout board turns on and off the built in light source of the breakout board and loops reading temperature and the 6 bands, and sends the results as a comma separated value (csv) string with 8 values; the first value indicating if this is a sample (1) or a dark (0) signal, the second the temperature followed by the 6 bands.

```






### Light PCB

The 5-pogo pins (see figure below) have the following functions on the light PCB:

| pin | function |
| 1 | Vin led (variable) |
| 2 | FB Extern resistor Vset |
| 3 | Vin 1-wire (+3.3 V) |
| 4  |  GND led |
| 5  | GND 1-wire |

<figcaption> PCB for bayonet light muzzle ("xspecled") for xSpectre's spectrometer version 0.78.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### 1-wire setup

1-wire memory units have 6 ports but only require 2 to operate. The 1-wire unit space on the xpsecled PCB is the upper right corner (see figure above), whit only 2 of the 6 (surface mounted) ports connected. As seen in the table above, the 1-wire unit connects to the pogo pins 3 and 5.

At the other end, the 1-wire connects to I/O port 19 of the microcontroller. The sketch below reads the id of the 1-wire connected via the bayonet mounted POGO pins.

```
/*
DS250x add-only programmable memory reader w/SKIP ROM.

 The DS250x is a 512/1024bit add-only PROM(you can add data but cannot change the old one) that's used mainly for device identification purposes
 like serial number, mfgr data, unique identifiers, etc. It uses the Maxim 1-wire bus.

 This sketch will use the SKIP ROM function that skips the 1-Wire search phase since we only have one device connected in the bus on digital pin 6.
 If more than one device is connected to the bus, it will fail.
 Sketch will not verify if device connected is from the DS250x family since the skip rom function effectively skips the family-id byte readout.
 thus it is possible to run this sketch with any Maxim OneWire device in which case the command CRC will most likely fail.
 Sketch will only read the first page of memory(32bits) starting from the lower address(0000h), if more than 1 device is present, then use the sketch with search functions.
 Remember to put a 4.7K pullup resistor between pin 6 and +Vcc

 To change the range or ammount of data to read, simply change the data array size, LSB/MSB addresses and for loop iterations

 This example code is in the public domain and is provided AS-IS.

 Built with Arduino 0022 and PJRC OneWire 2.0 library http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html

```

#### Light source setup

The power supply to the light source is via pogo pin 1 (see figure above). The power is only distributed to a single soldering block. To connect V+ to the mounting area for different light sources a surface mounted resistor need to be put at position R1.
