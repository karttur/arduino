### Introduction

In February 2022 [AMS](https://ams.com/) presented a 14-band filter based visible (VIS) to Near Infra Red (NIR) sensor - the [AMS AS7343 Spectral Sensor](https://ams.com/AS7343)

The AS7343 14-Channel Multi-Spectral Sensors integrate high-precision optical filters onto standard CMOS silicon via deposited interference filter technology. The sensors feature a spectral response that is defined by individual channels covering approximately 380nm to 900nm with 11 visible (VIS) channels and one Neat Infra Red (NIR) channel, plus channels for clear and flicker. It comes at a physical size of 3.1 x 2 x 1 mm.

The sensor is available from e.g. [Digikey](https://www.digikey.se/en/products/filter/optical-sensors-ambient-light-ir-uv-sensors/536?s=N4IgTCBcDaIIIGUDsBmALCkBdAvkA) prized for approximately 5 to 10 USD dependent on the amount you buy.
