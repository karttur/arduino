### Introduction

Versions 0.73 through 0.77 of xSpectre handheld spectrometer were built with incremental improvements in the bayonet mount, the fitting of the POGO pins and the general fitting of the PCB, the battery, and the BNC and GX16 expansions. As of version 0.76, the light muzzle for solid samples was redesigned to be built with a new customised Printed Circuit Board (PCB) - to be positioned horizontally rather than vertically in the light muzzle.  

A large part of the improvements were built using only the bayonet connectors and the lower section of the light muzzle, as illustrated in the 3D graphics of v0.76 below.
