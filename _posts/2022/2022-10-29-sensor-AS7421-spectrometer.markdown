### Introduction

In September 2022 [AMS](https://ams.com/) presented a 64-band Near Infra Red (NIR) sensor - the [AS7421 Hyperspectral NIR Sensor](https://ams.com/as7421).

The AS7343 64-Channel Hyper-Spectral sensors is built on a photodiode matrix and has a spectral range 750-1050nm (61 wavelengths, 5nm separation). Integrated micro optics to limit angle of incidence of sensor (Micro Lens Array). It operates using 16 independent ADCs with programmable gain and integration time
Typical integration time for 64 channel is 262ms - I²C interface and interrupt. Power consumption (typ): 2,5mA active, 2µA sleep. It comes at a physical size of 6.6 x 6 x 2.2mm.

[Mouser](https://www.mouser.se/c/?q=AS7421) advertises the AMS 64 band NIR sensor for €16 each when buying 10 or more, increasing to €24 for buying a single sensor. Expected to become available late January 2022.

There is an [Apple app](https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/mini-spectrometer-nir/id1635109082) for it.
