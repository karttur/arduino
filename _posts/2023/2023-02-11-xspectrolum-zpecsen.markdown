### Introduction

[ZpecSen](https://www.pozible.com/project/zpecsen-mobile-spectrometer-/) is (was?) a crowdfounded project by some Thai(?) scientists (working at the Spectroscopic and Sensing Devices Research Group part of [Nectec](https://www.nectec.or.th/en/)) to create a handheld spectromter fr both gases and liquids. It a mobile phone, both the camera for acquiring the spectral signal and as a processor. The wavelength range is thus compatibile with the visible bands, 450 nm â€“ 700 nm. It can be used for analysing open samples (solids) and cuvettes (liquids). It can hold 4 different light sources, dual cuvettes and have built-in spectral calibration. The shell is 3D printed.

There is a [Youtube presentation](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=youtube+ZpecSen&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:67b40c83,vid:0OOA-jwY4Dk) available. The cost for signing up for a single unit was 90 to 100 AUD (Australian dollar, equivalent to approximatel 70 to 75 USD), dependent on equipemnt. The project supposedly ended in February 2021; it is unclear if any units were sold or if the project continues.

The ZpecSen spectrometer is presented in the scientific article [A Low-Cost Dual-Beam Smartphone Visible Spectrometer](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00642).
