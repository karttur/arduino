The post on [CO<sub>2</sub> dual thermal sensors](../sensor-CO2dualsensor-comparison) identifies different options for Mid-InfraRed (MIR) spectral sensing of air content of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. This post instead summarises a Mid Infraa-Red (MIR) "plug-and-play"Nondispersive infrared (NDIR) gas detector for CO<sub>2</sub>.

### Introduction

NDIR gas detection relies on an emitter and a sensor placed opposite each other inside a dark chamber. The [Winsen MH-Z16 Infrared CO2 Gas Sensor](https://www.winsen-sensor.com/product/mh-z16.html) is built with a 10 cm long cylindrical chamber with a microcontroller on top. It runs on 5 Volt and 80 mA and can be attached to an Arduino microcontroller.


### MH-Z16 Infrared CO<sub>2</sub> Gas Sensor

[Gyawali et al, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00138/full) used the MH-Z16 sensor for developing an arduino based soil microbial activity assessment contraption (SMAAC). Or, stated more directly, a dual band MIR sensor that can be used for estimating soil CO<sub>2</sub> content and thus soil respiration.

[Gyawali et al, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00138/full) compared the SMAAC with a commercial infra-red gas analyzer (IRGA) and found that the SMAAC performed well as an inexpensive yet accurate tool for measuring soil respiration and microbial activity.

The [Winsen MH-Z16 Infrared CO2 Gas Sensor](https://www.winsen-sensor.com/product/mh-z16.html) is sold by many vendors. [DR-robot](https://wiki.dfrobot.com) sell their [own version under their Gravity](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Infrared_CO2_Sensor_0-50000ppm_SKU__SEN0220) series at 90 USD. Also [Seeed-studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com) sell [their own version - under their Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Carbon-Dioxide-Sensor-MH-Z16.html) series. It costs 98 USD.

Developing the SMAAC, [Gyawali et al, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00138/full) used an [MH-Z16 from Sandbox](https://sandboxelectronics.com/?product_tag=co2-sensor](https://sandboxelectronics.com/?product_tag=co2-sensor).

The Chinese company [Winsen](https://www.winsen-sensor.com/) produces the MH-Z16 CO<sub>2</sub> sensor, which is identicial to the above (probably it is the same). Buying this sensors in larger quantities at [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com) you can get the [Winsen plug-and-play CO<sub>2</sub> at 35 USD] (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004678211790.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.685d105dVZn6wH&algo_pvid=c125256c-1627-4826-8d7a-f46ac4d6aa62&algo_exp_id=c125256c-1627-4826-8d7a-f46ac4d6aa62-16&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000030070843054%22%7D&pdp_npi=2%40dis%21USD%21487.5%21360.75%21%21%21%21%21%402100bddf16676764667453237ec9c4%2112000030070843054%21sea&curPageLogUid=pv3FzfznqwwV).

I bought my copies of the MH-Z16 sensor from [Aliexpress](https://vi.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-MH%2525252dZ16.html?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20230311124233&SearchText=MH-Z16&spm=a2g0o.home.1000002.0) where you can get one (1) for as little as 35 USD if you buy several in one go.

[Seeedstudio](https://www.seeedstudio.com) also offers a smaller CO<sub>2</sub> [NDIR at 600 SEK](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-CO2-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-SCD30-p-2911.html?queryID=6ad894478cb9df5ce4aed3e405677da2&objectID=2911&indexName=bazaar_retailer_products).

### Sketch

Example code for integrating this sensor with the Arduino is available at [https://github.com/SandboxElectronics/NDIRZ16](https://github.com/SandboxElectronics/NDIRZ16).

Seeed-studio provides [setup instructons including an Arduino sketch](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-CO2_Sensor/). But the code does not operate properly. A corrected code is offered by [devmobilenz](https://blog.devmobile.co.nz/2019/02/01/carbon-dioxide-sensormh-z16-library-comparison/). For details see the [project post](../../project/project-nh-z16-co2/).
