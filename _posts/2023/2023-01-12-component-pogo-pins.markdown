### Introduction

The [previous post on Connection components](../component-PCB-connectors) listed the different connection methods that I have tried for attacing the light and sample holders ("muzzles") to the main spectrometer casing (box).

Starting with xSpectrolum<b>+</b> v079 the selected solution is right angle 5-pinned pogo-pins both for the male (main) and female (muzzle) connectors. This post briefly summarizes the selected pogo-pins.

### Pogo pins

Pogo pins come in a large variety of form factors and number of actual pins. For version 0.79 and higher, 5-pinned right angle pogo-pins are used. Right-angle pins are less common, and the versions used in xSpectrolum are not available from the usual component suppliers. Instead I get the pogo-pins from [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com).

#### Male pogo pins

The male pogo pins are attached to the main Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The design of the PCB requires a tightly designed connector. The design of versions 0.79 and above is made for the [TangDa right angle 5-pin pogo-pins](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/32937109716.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.11.1e7f1802T1KnC9&gatewayAdapt=glo2vnm).

#### Female pogo pins

The pogo-pin that fits the muzzle PCB is the [RIPZV right angle female 5-pin pogo-pin](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005003579709688.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.58.44541802qVFyIM&gatewayAdapt=glo2vnm).
