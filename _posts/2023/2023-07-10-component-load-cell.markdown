### Introduction

A load cells is a device that measures the load, or force applied to it by converting the force into an electrical signal. It consists of a metal structure, called the spring element, that deforms when a force is applied to it.


[TE Connectivity FX29](https://se.rs-online.com/web/p/strain-gauges/2163488?cm_mmc=SE-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-PLA_SE_EN_Automation_%26_Control_Gear_Whoop-_-(SE:Whoop!)+Strain+Gauges-_-2163488&matchtype=&aud-827186183686:pla-299641590457&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzdOlBhCNARIsAPMwjbx4yF8-xbqdZA2ltW-pK3nHrnVqo8vzESAYUu0ZQY77uPObk6VWSy0aAmMKEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) is a more advanced connectivity load cell (RS-online) that also has an optional I2c Interface.

A cheaper RS485/MODBUS interface load cell @ 8 USD based o the WG18A02 breakout board: https://manyfavours.com/products/dc-5v-12v-rs485-uart-modbus-rtu-hx711-pressure-weight-sensor-electronic-scale-module-for-plc-configuration-software. I then found it with [Aliexpress.com](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004379484617.html) and bought two copies 20230717.
