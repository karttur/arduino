## Introduction

This is not really an Arduino module but links to a stand alone sensor that mesures methane (CH4) and Hydrogen (H) as a way to analyze gut functions. This could be chieved with the xSpectre spectrometer by adding a breathing component that anlyse the spectral absurbance of the gas flow.
