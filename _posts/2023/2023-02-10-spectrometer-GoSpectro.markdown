### Introduction

[GoSpectro](https://gospectro.eu/product/gospectro/) uses a smartphone or tablet camera as a spectral sensor and can thus acquire spectral signals in the visible (VIS) range between 400 and 750 nm. It is reported to have a spectral resolution of 10 nm and reproducibility of 1 nm. At time of updating this in April 2023, the prize for a GoSpectro is €415.

The company behind GoSpectro is [GoyaLab](https://www.goyalab.com/fr/) from France. GoyaLab also offers the [IndiGo](https://gospectro.eu/indigo/) spectrometer that is more advanced and versatile. It is prized at €2109.

In the shop [https://gospectro.eu/product/handheld-spectrometer-high-cri-white-leds-400-750-nm/] also another handheld spectrometer (TTO<sup>3</sup>?) is offered. This seems to be somewhere in between the GoSpectro and the IndiGo and is prized as €1550.
