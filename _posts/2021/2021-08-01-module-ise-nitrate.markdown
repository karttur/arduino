### Introduction

Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE)

### PASCO nitrate sensor

PASCO offers an [ISE for nitrate (ps-3521)](https://www.pasco.com/products/sensors/wireless/ps-3521) that fits directly with the same BNC connection as the PASCO pH-meter. In Sweden this ISE probe is sold by [Sagitta](https://www.sagitta.se/artikel/nitrate-ise-no3-probe?sok=PS-3521).

This means that it also fits xSpectre's standard BNC connection....

### PASCO Ammonium sensor

PASCO offers an [ISE for ammonium (ps-3516)](https://www.pasco.com/products/sensors/wireless/ps-3516) that fits directly with the same BNC connection as the PASCO pH-meter. In Sweden this ISE probe is sold by [Sagitta](PS-3516).

### PASCO Calcium sensor

PASCO offers an [ISE for calcium (ps-3518)](https://www.pasco.com/products/sensors/wireless/ps-3518) that fits directly with the same BNC connection as the PASCO pH-meter. In Sweden this ISE probe is sold by [Sagitta](https://www.sagitta.se/artikel/calcium-ise-ca2?sok=PS-3518).

### PASCO Chloride sensor

PASCO offers an [ISE for calcium (ps-3519)](https://www.pasco.com/products/sensors/wireless/ps-3519) that fits directly with the same BNC connection as the PASCO pH-meter. In Sweden this ISE probe is sold by [Sagitta](https://www.sagitta.se/artikel/chloride-ise-cl-probe?sok=ps-3519#.YQZ45y0RrOQ).

### PASCO Potassium sensor

PASCO offers an [ISE for potassium (ps-3520)](https://www.pasco.com/products/sensors/wireless/ps-3520) that fits directly with the same BNC connection as the PASCO pH-meter. In Sweden this ISE probe is sold by [Sagitta](https://www.sagitta.se/artikel/potassium-ise-k-probe#.YQZ5TS0RrOQ).

### PASCO CO2 sensor

PASCO offers an [ISE for carbon dioxide (ps-3517)](https://www.pasco.com/products/sensors/wireless/ps-3517) that fits directly with the same BNC connection as the PASCO pH-meter. In Sweden this ISE probe is sold by [Sagitta](https://www.sagitta.se/artikel/carbon-dioxide-ise-co2#.YQZ5-i0RrOQ).
