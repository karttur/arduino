### Introduction

In 2018 Arduino presented a [new family of the popular NANO micro controller board](https://www.hackster.io/news/introducing-four-new-arduino-nanos-869b8abbccb4):

- NANO Every
- NANO 33 IOT
- NANO 33 BLE
- NANO 33 SENSE

A comparison is presented by [makerguide](https://www.makerguides.com/arduino-nano/).

Of these boards, the [NANO IOT 33 board](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-iot) is the most versatile (I think). A good summary of its capabilities has been published by [ITP Physical Computing](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/introduction-to-the-nano-33-iot/).

Compared to the older NANO boards, the NANO IOT 33 has a faster processor, inbuilt wifi and bluetooth connections and a 3-axis gyrometer. Despite these additions, the IOT 33 has the same form factor as earlier NANO boards.

### Availability and costs

At [Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-iot) the NANO IOT 33 microcontroller costs 16 € (March 2021). In Sweden you can get it at [PchButik](https://pchbutik.se/kretskort/1587-arduino-nano-33-iot-losa-stiftlist-ingar.html) at 239 SEK (22 €).
