### Introduction

[Hamamatsu](https://www.hamamatus.com) offers a series of [singe cell compact (TO-5) sensors with an InGaAs PIN photodiode and a Fabry-Perot Interferometer (MEMS-FPI) tunable filter](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mems-fpi-spectrum-sensor.html) that can vary its transmission wavelength depending on the applied voltage.

### Versions

The MEMS-FPI sensor is available for four different wavelengths (nm):

- 1750 - 2150 [C14273](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mems-fpi-spectrum-sensor/C14273.html)
- 1550 - 1850 [C13272-02](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mems-fpi-spectrum-sensor/C13272-02.html)
- 1550 - 1850 [C13272-03](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mems-fpi-spectrum-sensor/C13272-03.html)
- 1350 - 1650 [C14272](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mems-fpi-spectrum-sensor/C14272.html)

A TO-5 house has a diameter of 8.2 mm and a rim that is 9.14 mm. The height of the Hamamatus MEMS-FPI TO-05 housing is approximately 5.8 mm, including rim (0.4 mm)

Buying between 5 and 9 the price from Hamamatsu is approximately 200 USD per piece.

#### Complete modules

Hamamatsu also offers the MEM-FPI sensors as plug-and-play [spectrometer modules](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/spectroscopic-modules.html) with emitters and electronics. A single unit the costs 1700 USD.
