## xSpectrolum version v0.04

Version 0.04 was an attempt to construct a spectrometer using the [Hamamatsu C12880MA](http://localhost:4000/sensor/sensor-C12880MA-spectrometer/) sensor and the same platform as [version 0.032](../spectrolum-v0032/). This version was only assembled on a breadboard and never as a stand alone unit. The main reason for this was that we replaced the original [NANO v3 microcontroller board](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano) with the more capable [NANO IOT 33 board](../../module/module-nano-iot-33). And thus skipped building version 0.04 and instead went for [version 0.05](../spectrolum-v0051/).

As a sidenote - the [sketch](https://github.com/groupgets/c12880ma) for running the [Hamamatsu C12880MA](http://localhost:4000/sensor/sensor-C12880MA-spectrometer/) off an Arduino board, presented by [GroupGets](https://groupgets.com/manufacturers/getlab/products/c12880ma-breakout-board) worked fine with the Arduino UNO (see photo) or NANO boards. The more [advanced code](https://github.com/open-eio/arduino-microspec) presented by [Versek et al (2019)](https://impfs.github.io/review/) however requires newer boards, including for instance the [NANO IOT 33](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-iot).
