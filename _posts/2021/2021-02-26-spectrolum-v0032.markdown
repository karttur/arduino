Version 0.032 is outdated.

## Stulturum spectrometer version v0.032

{: .pull-right}
The new idea for version 0.03 has been to move all the light sources to the external attachments. This also led to the idea of replacing the magnet for holding the attachments in place and instead look for a connector that could be used both for powering the external light and for holding attachments in place. The solution I came up with was to use a TRX connector (shown to the right), with the female sitting in the box and the male in the attachment.

As the additional light sources require different voltage, each attached light contains a resistor adjusting the power, plus the light source. This simplifies the wiring on the electronics inside the box itself. Also v0.032 contains a battery and the breakout boards controlling the charging and drainage of the battery, a fixed DC to DC stepup module outputting 5 volt, and a power switch.

### Spectrometer box

The box holding all the components is changed to accommodate the female TRX connector.

### Spectrometer sample and light source attachments

The sample holders for version 0.03x also include the required light sources. As explained above, the samplers are attached to the spectrometer box using TRX connections. The light, samples and spectral sensor are thus always lines up in the most optimal manner regarding each sample type and light source.

### Issues

The DC-DC 5 volt stepup module does not boost the voltage all the way from the lithium battery 3.7 V to 5 V. It only reaches up to 4 V. With no load the stepup modules outputs 6 V. The best solution would be to have a more powerful DC-DC stepup module and connect the external power to the VIN port of the Arduino Nano board.

### Modules and components

Apart from the Arduino Nano microcontroller, there are a total of X different modules/components included in Stulturum's spectrometer version v0.019. To get more information, including the separate scripts for individual controls, follow the links.
