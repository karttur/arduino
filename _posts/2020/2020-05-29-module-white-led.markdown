### Introduction

Should be 5700 kelvin and maybe 20 mA. But I cannot find that.

Searching google with the words "arduino white led 40mA":

Looking for a white LED to replace the one that is builtin on the modules integrating the AMS 6-band spectrometer, I came across across one alternative developed for lilypad at [fyndiq.se](https://fyndiq.se/product/42078820-5pcs-3v-5v-40ma-mini-lilypad-led-smd/?utm_source=shopello_se&utm_medium=cpo&utm_campaign=google%20shopping%20ads&utm_term=installationsmaterial-477&utm_content=CjwKCAjw5cL2BRASEiwAENqAPqrW_ImE_nvzK6-VsUR1KlkAHRSP48AZyok-XnONrZGKEhsDIsUzhxoCpzMQAvD_BwE). But these are widely available. But I do not think it is the right stuff.

If you search [alibaba.com](#), you get the right stuff, but minimum purchase in in the thousands:

- "white LED 20 mA 3 v"
- "white LED 20 mA 3 v 5700 k"

#### Even stronger

To have an even stronger LED you need a mosfet solution, like explained in this Youtube instruction:
