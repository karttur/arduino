### Introduction

Red lasers at 650 nm are quite common as components or breakout boards (modules). Actually pinning down which laser it is, is not so easy. I have different versions, and I am not sure if they are 3 or 5 v, or 1 or 5 mW. They do differ slightly is diameter and also in the focus of the beam. So I think they are different.

### KY-008 Arduino Laser Module
I got a [KY-008 Arduino Laser Module](https://www.instructables.com/id/Keyes-KY-008-Laser-Transmitter-Demystified/) as part of a [kit with 40 modules](https://rydepier.wordpress.com/2015/06/13/list-of-keyes-boardssensors-for-arduino/). If I study it under a looking glass it seems that resistor says 103, which should equal 10 kOhm. That is way too much. So I am lost again. The theoretical calculation, given that it is actually a 3v laser at 40 mW, is that it should require 50 Ohm rather.
