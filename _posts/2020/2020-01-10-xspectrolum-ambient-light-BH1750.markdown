### Introduction

BH1750FVI is a digital Ambient Light Sensor IC for [I2C bus interface](../../ide/ide-I2C).  It detects a wide range of wavelengths at high resolution (1 - 65535 lx). It is produced by [ROHM](http://rohmfs.rohm.com) that also provide a [datasheet](http://rohmfs.rohm.com/en/products/databook/datasheet/ic/sensors/light/bh1721fvc-e.pdf).

The component is outdated, but was used for the first of xspectrolums's test-spectrometers.
