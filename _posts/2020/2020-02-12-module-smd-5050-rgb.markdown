### Introduction

Module with Light-emitting diode (LED) for red (R) green (G) and blue (B) with separate power for each and the potential to create all colors between blue and red as apparent output.

Modules centered around the Light-emitting diode (LED) SMD 5050 RGB differ in many ways, selecting the best solution depends on your project.  At the other end there are breakout boards that include the resistors and that have three connectors, 5 v power (5v), ground (- or GND) and one for controll. Most of these kinds can also pass the connection on, and also have connectors for outgoing 5 v power (5v) and ground (- or GND). The third connections is then typically labelled DI and DO for data in and data out. You can connect these in almost endless series, as outlined below.
