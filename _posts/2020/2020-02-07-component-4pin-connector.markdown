### Introduction



#### SHTXY moisture and temperature sensor

From the [Adafruit product page](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1298): Old version with four color wires: Red = VCC (3-5VDC), Black or Green = Ground, Yellow = Clock, Blue = Data
Newer version with four color wires: Red = VCC (3-5VDC), Black = Ground, Yellow = Clock, Green = Data

table 1: Complete connection in Karttur's mojj√§ng


| socket | SHTXY wire | 4-pin code | 4-pin wire | nano port |
| VCC | red* | 4 | red | 5v |
| GND | green | 2 | black | GND |
| Clock | yellow | 3 | yellow | D11 |
| Data  | blue* | 1 | blue | D10 |

With 5v power there should be a 10 K Ohm resistor between VCC and the Data (blue and red) I have squeezed that resistor into the 4-pin connector.
