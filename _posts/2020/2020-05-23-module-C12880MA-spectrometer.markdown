### Introduction

Hamamatsu's [C12880MA ultra-compact spectrometer](https://www.hamamatsu.com/jp/en/product/type/C12880MA/index.html) is at time of writing this (May 2020) perhaps the best option for a miniaturised spectrometer to put with a micro-controller.

### Versions

The C12880MA spectrometer is the second generation of this miniaturised sensor. Here are the specs as listed on [Hamamatus's own data sheet](https://www.hamamatsu.com/resources/pdf/ssd/c12880ma_kacc1226e.pdf):

- Size: 20.1 × 12.5 × 10.1 mm
- Weight: 5 g
- Spectral response range: 340 to 850 nm
- Spectral resolution: 15 nm max.
- Hermetic package
- Wavelength conversion factor is listed on test result sheet.


### Breakout boards

The C12880MA sensor is available as [Arduino breakout boards](../../modules/module-C12880MA-spectrometer).
