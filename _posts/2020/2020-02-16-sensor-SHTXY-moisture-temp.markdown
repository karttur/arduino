### Introduction

The SHTXY series of digital humidity and temperature sensors from [Sensirion](https://www.sensirion.com) are high quality and available for Arduino as integrated breakout boards from various producers.

### SHT1x

The [SHT1x digital humidity sensor](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors/digital-humidity-sensors-for-accurate-measurements/) is a reflow solderable sensor. The SHT1x series consists of a low-cost version with the SHT10 humidity sensor, a standard version with the SHT11 humidity sensor, and a high-end version with the SHT15 humidity sensor. As with every other Sensirion sensor type from the SHTxx humidity sensor family, they are fully calibrated and provide a digital output.

The humidity sensors are seamlessly coupled to a 14-bit-analog-to-digital converter and a serial interface circuit. This results in superior signal quality, a fast response time, and insensitivity to external disturbances (EMC).

Even if the SHT1x series of sensors was dis-continued in 2018, but there are still many breakout boards available. I also have couple of cabled and metal cased [SHT10 sensor from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1298).

### SHT3x

The new generation of [SHT3x series](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors/digital-humidity-sensors-for-various-applications/) are available as integrated breakout boards, e.g. from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2857). The [SHT-30 Mesh-protected Weather-proof Temperature/Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4099) is actually half price compared to the old SHT10 model. Great, just have to get it. At [Alibaba.com](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Taidacent-SHT30-temperature-gauge-sensor-pi_60775152726.html?spm=a2700.details.maylikeexp.1.34566a84FkDeUQ) you can get at 12-13 USD with a plastic encasing.
