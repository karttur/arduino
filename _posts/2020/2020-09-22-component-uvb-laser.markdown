### Introduction

In flourescence spectroscopy the sample, that can be a solid, a liquid or a gas, is excited with a high energy, short wave laser, and the glow that results is registered by spectral sensor. For liquid and gaseous samples, the laser beam is directed 90 degrees away from the spectral sensor in order for the glow to be the captured spectral signal. In this post I listed different ultra violet (UV) to blue laser light sources that I have found. Only lasers with wavelengths of 405 nm or shorter are listed. In fact, only lasers at 405 nm are listed as shorter wavelength lasers costs thousands of USD.

### Laser diodes

[Egismos](https://www.egismos.com) sell [laser diodes for optoelectrical](https://www.egismos.com/laser-diode.html) application of wavelengths ranging from 405 to 1550 nm. [Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com) also sells [laser diodes](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_id=2164&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs5zWuLH_6wIVDKWyCh3rAwX7EAAYASAAEgLvpfD_BwE), at even wider range from 375 nm to 2000 nm. But as the prices are very high, these components are out of range for our purposes.

[Prophotonix](https://www.prophotonix.com/led-and-laser-products/laser-diodes/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiI2fqaz_6wIVQemyCh0IogMZEAAYAiAAEgKNh_D_BwE) offers a range of laser diodes from Ushio, Osram, Panasonic, QSI and Ondax. [Laserdiodesource](https://www.laserdiodesource.com/) is a similar marketplace for laser diodes.

Other than red lasers, I have not really found any vendor in Sweden that sells neither green, not blue (or UV) laser components in Sweden. Some are avialble at [highcap.se](https://highcap.se/product_search.php?search_query=lasermodul), but at exaggerated prices. Laser pointers of different wavelengths are available from [ledmegastore.se](https://ledmegastore.se).

### Blue lasers

The best price, and that should work for us, are the blue laser diodes from [Changchun Sunday OptoElectronics Co., Ltd](https://sunday-optics.en.alibaba.com/) that offer [405 nm laser diodes](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Blue-405nm-laser-diode-5mw-10mw_1878035277.html?spm=a2700.gallery_search_cps.normalList.17.71d8f3e5RkppV6) for between 2 and 5 USD each (dependent on strength and purchase volume).

#### Banggood laser pointers

[Banggood.com](https://www.banggood.com) has several low power blue laser pointers at 405 nm available:
