### Introduction

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org) is a scaled down version of Python and can be run on microcontrollers (Ãƒrdruino type of boards but with larger RAM and ROM). MicroPython is then its own Operating System. Otherwise it works like Python. You write and compile the script direcly on the board - your computer is only involved as a screen and keyboard.

[CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) is [Adrafuit's](https://www.adafruit.com) dialect of MicroPython.

### Boards

[MicroPython](https://store.micropython.org) and [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-hardware) offer microcontroller boards prepared for MicroPython/CircuitPython. Maybe the easiest to start with is the Metro M0 Express. It looks and behaves simialr to an Arduino UNO board but can also run CircuitPython. It is even avliabel from [Elfa.se](https://www.elfa.se/sv/adafruit-metro-m0-express-adafruit-3505/p/30129229) fr approximately 30 USD.
