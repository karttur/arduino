### Introduction

BH1750FVI is a digital Ambient Light Sensor IC for [I2C bus interface](../../ide/ide-I2C).  It is possible to detect wide range at High resolution (1 - 65535 lx). It is produced by [ROHM](http://rohmfs.rohm.com) that also provide a [datasheet](http://rohmfs.rohm.com/en/products/databook/datasheet/ic/sensors/light/bh1721fvc-e.pdf).

The component is outdated, there are more advanced ambient light sensors available. Please see the [ambient light modules](../../modules/module-ambient-light).
