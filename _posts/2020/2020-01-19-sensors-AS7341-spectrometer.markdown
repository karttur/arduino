### Introduction

The [AMS AS7341 11-band spectral sensor](https://ams.com/ko/as7341?fbclid=IwAR3RyybhA7qlqQo8N8hP6GgB0USwy7JsjBKn_7Tohk5hR1qRGd4WeozAuhA) was launched in 2019 and is not yet (January 2020) available as a module. To use it at this time you have to solder it together with all required components to make it work.

To me it seems like a later and upgraded version of the [AMS AS726x series of spectral sensing engines](https://ams.com/AS7261), also linked in [this post](../sensors-AS726X-spectrometer).


At [digi-key you can get it as development kit](https://www.digikey.se/products/en/development-boards-kits-programmers/evaluation-boards-sensors/795?k=ams%20as7341).
