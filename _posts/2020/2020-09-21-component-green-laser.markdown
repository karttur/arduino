### Introduction

In Raman spectroscopy the sample, that can be a solid, a liquid or a gas, is excited with a green to red/red edge laser, and the glow that results is registered by a spectral sensor. For liquid and gaseous samples, the laser beam is directed 90 degrees away from the spectral sensor in order for the glow to be the captured spectral signal. In this post I listed different green laser light sources that I have found.

### Laser diodes

[Egismos](https://www.egismos.com) sell [laser diodes for optoelectrical](https://www.egismos.com/laser-diode.html) application of wavelengths ranging from 405 to 1550 nm. [Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com) also sells [laser diodes](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_id=2164&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs5zWuLH_6wIVDKWyCh3rAwX7EAAYASAAEgLvpfD_BwE), at even wider range from 375 nm to 2000 nm. But as the prices are very high, these components are out of range for our purposes.

[Prophotonix](https://www.prophotonix.com/led-and-laser-products/laser-diodes/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiI2fqaz_6wIVQemyCh0IogMZEAAYAiAAEgKNh_D_BwE) offers a range of laser diodes from Ushio, Osram, Panasonic, QSI and Ondax. [Laserdiodesource](https://www.laserdiodesource.com/) is a smiliar marketplace for laser diodes.

Other than red lasers, I have not really found any vendor in Sweden that sells neither green, nor blue (or UV) laser components in Sweden. Some are available at [highcap.se](https://highcap.se/product_search.php?search_query=lasermodul), but at exaggerated prices. Laser pointers of different wavelengths are available from [ledmegastore.se](https://ledmegastore.se).

#### Banggood laser components

[Banggood.com](https://www.banggood.com) has several low power green laser pointers and components available:

- [XANES GD04 Laser 301 Green Laser Pointer](https://www.banggood.com/Burning-Laser-301-Green-Laser-Pointer-Flashlight-High-Power-Laser-p-942416.html?rmmds=detail-lefthotproducts__6&cur_warehouse=CN#customerQA)
- [515nm 35mW Green Laser Diode](https://www.banggood.com/515nm-35mW-Green-Laser-Diode-Module-Laser-Generator-For-Laser-Level-Marker-Instrument-Line-Positioning-p-1442454.html?rmmds=detail-left-hotproducts__7&cur_warehouse=CN)
