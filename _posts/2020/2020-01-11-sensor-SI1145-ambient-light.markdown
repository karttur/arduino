### Introduction

SI1145 is a digital Ambient Light Sensor IC for [I2C bus interface](../../ide/ide-I2C). It can detect from ultraviolet (UV) via visisble to InfraRed (IR). It is produced by [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com) that also provide a [datasheet](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si1145-46-47.pdf).

I can not, in January 2020, find this component on any breakout board for sale in Sweden.
