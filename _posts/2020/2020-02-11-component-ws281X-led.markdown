### Introduction

These SMD 5050 components are individually addressable RGB LEDs - this means with just 3 wires, you can make each LED turn any one of 16 million colours. There a many different versions: WS2811/WS2812/WS2812B/APA104/APA106/SK6812, but all work the same way electrically. [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/WS2811) have a short introduction to programmable LEDs. The Youtube [LED Strips, what's the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnvircC22hU) is more in depth and explains some of the differences between the listed components. It is a good point to start when selecting what kind to chose for your project.
