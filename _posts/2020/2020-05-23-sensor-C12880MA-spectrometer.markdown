### Introduction

Hamamatsu's [C12880MA ultra-compact spectrometer](https://www.hamamatsu.com/jp/en/product/type/C12880MA/index.html) is at time of writing this (May 2020) perhaps the best option for a minituarized spectrometer to put with a micro-controller.

### Versions

The C12880MA spectrometer is the second generation of this minituarized sensor. Here are the specs as listed on [Hamamatus's own page](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/type/C12880MA/index.html):

- Size: 20.1 × 12.5 × 10.1 mm
- Weight: 5 g
- Spectral response range: 340 to 850 nm
- Spectral resolution: 15 nm max.
- Hermetic package
- Wavelength conversion factor is listed on test result sheet.

### Breakout boards

The C12880MA sensor is available as [Arduino breakout boards](../../modules/module-C12880MA-spectrometer).

### Alternative

[Hasun optoelectronics HK co., LTD](http://www.hasunopto.com) also offers the [C12880MA spectrometer](http://hasunoptokr.sell.everychina.com/p-110163030-c14486ga-c14214ma-c12880ma-c14384ma-01-c11708ma-c10988ma-01-c13053ma-c12666ma.html) and other Hamamatsu spectrometers.
