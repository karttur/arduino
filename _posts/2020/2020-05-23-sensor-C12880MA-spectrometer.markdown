### Introduction

Hamamatsu's [C12880MA ultra-compact spectrometer](https://www.hamamatsu.com/jp/en/product/type/C12880MA/index.html) is at time of writing this (May 2020) perhaps the best option for a minituarized spectrometer to put with a micro-controller. It has a spectral response range of 340 to 850 nm, 288 pixels, and 256 channels with 15 nm of resolution. The internal CMOS image sensor and optics are hermetically sealed to increase humidity resistance.
