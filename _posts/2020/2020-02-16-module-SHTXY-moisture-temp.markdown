### Introduction

The SHTXY series of digital humidity and temperature sensors from [Sensiron](https://www.sensirion.com) are high quality and available for Arduino as integrated breakout boards from various producers.

The [SHT1x series](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors/digital-humidity-sensors-for-accurate-measurements/) of sensors was dis-continued in 2018, but there are still many breakout boards available. I also have couple of cabled and metal cased [SHT10 sensor from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1298).

The new generation of [SHT3x sensors from Sensirion](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors/digital-humidity-sensors-for-various-applications/) are available as integrated breakout boards, e.g. from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2857). The [SHT-30 Mesh-protected Weather-proof Temperature/Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4099) is actually half price compared to the old SHT10 model. Great, just have to get it.
