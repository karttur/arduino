### Introduction

![trx-connector](../../images/trx_connector_female-male.png)
{: .pull-right}
Searching for a power connector that could be used both for power transfer to extern actuators _and_ hold external attachments in place, I found the TRX system. TRX is popular among makers of different types of vehicles.

### Access

TRX connectors are available all over. I got TRX connectors from [kullagergrossisten.se](https://www.kullagergrossisten.se/product/trx-kontakt-par-).
