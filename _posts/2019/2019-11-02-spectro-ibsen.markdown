### Ibsen

[Ibsen photonics](https://ibsen.com) produces small spectrometers that integrate a grating, a sensor and electronics. The sensor seems to usually be Hamamatsu. This is cool, but is in essence what I have in my homebuilt spectrometer.

The most interesting spectrometers at a first glance seems to be:

[PEBBLE Ultra Compact OEM Spectrometers](https://ibsen.com/products/oem-spectrometers/pebble-spectrometers/), and the [product sheet](https://ibsen.com/wp-content/uploads/Ibsen-Product-Sheets-PEBBLE-VIS.pdf). This is a miniature spectrometer with Wavelength Range 380-850 nm. In July 2020 Ibsen announced that it would become available as a [PEBBLE evaluation package mounted on a breakout board](https://shop.ibsen.com/product/pebble-evaluation-package/). The cost was set to 2300 € (2660 $).

[Compact and cost-efficient OEM spectrometer modules for the VIS-NIR range](https://ibsen.com/products/oem-spectrometers/freedom-spectrometers/freedom-vis-nir/), and the [product sheet](https://ibsen.com/wp-content/uploads/Ibsen-Product-Sheets-FREEDOM-VIS-NIR.pdf). 475-1100 nm


In July 2020 Ibsen introduced a new [FREEDOM VIS FSV-101](https://www.gophotonics.com/products/spectrometers/ibsen-photonics/44-841-freedom-vis-fsv-101) spectrometer with Wavelength Range 360 to 830 nm. The central part of the spectrometer is a [Hamamatsu S11639 CMOS](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/type/S11639-01/index.html) detector. [Integrated with an electronic circuit, or breakout board, with an Arduino board and all peripherals and software costs 2000 € (2260 $)](https://shop.ibsen.com/product/freedom-arduino-kit/?wmc-currency=USD).
