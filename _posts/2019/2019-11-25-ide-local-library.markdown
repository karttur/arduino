### Introduction

Code packages that connects an Arduino board to different devices, including break out boards, sensors, displays, communication and storage devices, are available from different libraries. The <span class='app'>Arduino</span> app has a library manager that you reach from the menu:

<span class='menu'>Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries</span>

The basics for handling libraries is explained on Ardiuons official page [Installing Additional Arduino Libraries](www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

The [Arduino hacking page on libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries) summarises how to include both public and private libraries. The page includes a link to a test library and explains were to put your own libraries to have access to them when sketching.
