## Introduction

In this post I investigate the different options for connecting external sensors to an arduino sensor unit.

### Basic alternatives

Micro USB: Standard, but not so common for DIY.

2-4 Pin JST plug: These are small and fairly easy, but a bit instable and sensitive. If space is crucial this could be the alternative.

XLR plug: These are for audio signal transfer. I got some of these as a try. Internationally you can get XLR with any number of pins, also as chassis for mounting in box. In Sweden the options are more limiting.

GX Aviation plug: Rather cool and sturdy, but that is the problem: sturdy and space consuming.
