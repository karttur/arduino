### I2C communication bus

Some Arduino components ommunicate with the board (Arduino) using the [I2C protocol (communication bus)](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/how-i2c-communication-works-and-how-to-use-it-with-arduino/). I2C is very popular because it can carry signals from multiple sensors (devices). This is possible because each sensor is given a unique serial address (id). The sensor data is sent in a serial address format using only two (2) wires: Serial Clock (or SCL) and Serial Data (or SDA). The SCL line is the clock signal which synchronize the data transfer between the devices on the I2C bus and itâ€™s generated by the master device. The other line is the SDA line which carries the data.

I think that you can link up different sensors and then send the data through the I2C protocol. Another alternative is to softwire other ports than SCL and SDA to communicate using the I2C protocol. Arduino have a page on [Software I2C library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/SoftwareI2CLibrary/) that should be possible to implement. One of the alternatives linked on that page is to "another bit-banging I2C library": [SlowSoftI2CMaster](https://github.com/felias-fogg/SlowSoftI2CMaster).

#### Preparing the Arduino IDE

Your Arduino board have the SCL and SDA ports required for the I2C communication bus. If you are using one of [Arduino's standard boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/boards) they should be included with the latest version of <span class='app'>[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)</span>.

If instead you are using a board from a partner, you probably need to configure Arduino IDE for that particular board. As an example, you can look at the manuals for how to [configure Arduino for the Adafruit's Metro Express board](https://learn.adafruit.com/experimenters-guide-for-metro/configure-arduino-for-the-metro-express).

#### Arduino library

Code packages that connects an Arduino board to different devices, including break out boards, sensors, displays, communication and storage devices, are available from different libraries. The <span class='app'>Arduino</span> app has a library manager that you reach from the menu:

<span class='menu'>Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries</span>

The basics for handling libraries is explained on Ardiuons official page [Installing Additional Arduino Libraries](www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).
