### Introduction

The [AMS AS726X series of spectral sensing engines](https://ams.com/AS7261) are miniaturised broad band spectrometers, that are also available as modules for use with e.g. Arduino.

Breakout boards, modules, with the AMS AS726X sensor are available from from both [Sparkfun](../../sensors/sensors-AS726X-spectrometer/) and [adafruit](../../sensors/sensors-AS726X-spectrometer/). The main difference is that the Sparkfun components come with their [qwiic connectors](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) that does not need soldering (unless you want to).

Cheaper alternative from [pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/as7262-6-channel-spectral-sensor-spectrometer-breakout), also available from [ebay uk](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/143307220364), or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AS7262-6-channel-Spectral-Spectrometer-Breakout/dp/B07RCGKNPQ).

### Adafruit

Adafruit only offers the [visible sensor engine as an integrated module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3779). The Adafruit component costs 20 USD.

Adafruit offers a nice blog on wiring including a small TFT-screen ["Adafruit AS7262 6-Channel Visible Light / Color Sensor Breakout"](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/03/29/new-product-adafruit-as7262-6-channel-visible-light-color-sensor-breakout/)

The Adafruit AMS AS7262 breakout board is available in Sweden from [Elfa](https://www.elfa.se/sv/as7262-koppling-till-sensor-foer-synligt-ljus-och-faerg-3v-adafruit-3779/p/30139177?channel=b2c&price_gs=237.5&wt_mc=se.cse.gshop.sv.-&source=googleps&ext_cid=shgooaqsesv-blcss&kw=%7Bkeyword%7D&&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-4nuBRCnARIsAHwyuPqSPZTEjfoprswfdB8c7i0HC-y9g0DKSvoAV360DCei4QqBRgstdysaAlipEALw_wcB), priced at 237.50 SKE incl. VAT.

### Sparkfun

Sparkfun offers the AMS AS726X sensor engines as barebone components:

- [AS7261 RGB+NIR](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15490)
- [AS7262 Visible bands](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15491)
- [AS7263 Red to NIR bands](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15492)

At time of writing this (January 2020) they are approximately 9 USD each.

Sparkfun also offers modules with integrated the AMS AS726X sensor engines and light sources. Only two of the three sensors components are offered as single breakout boards:

- [AS7262 Visible bands](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14347)
- [AS7263 Red to NIR bands](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14351)

These two modules are priced at approximately 26 USD each.

Sparkfun also offers a [breakout board that combines all three AMS spectrometers to an 18 channel spectrometer (SparkFun Triad Spectroscopy Sensor - AS7265x)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15050), prized at approximately 65 USD.

I bought the Sparkfun modules from [digi-key Sweden](https://www.digikey.se), they arrived within 48 hours at my doorstep (now shipment cost). I was rather impressed by that.

### Pimoroni

There is, at least, one more producer, [pimoroni.com](https://pimoroni.com), that offers the [AMS AS7262 visible spectrometer](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/as7262-6-channel-spectral-sensor-spectrometer-breakout), at a slightly lower price.

### Mouser

[Demo kit available from mouser](https://www.mouser.se/ProductDetail/ams/AS7265X-DEMO-KIT-V30?qs=sGAEpiMZZMt6ebhnBMWiDOYh%2FMrMJUWru3SwCgM89GEEPBr%252BOZV9NQ%3D%3D) with all three sensors in one module (similar to the [sparkfun product](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15050) but at almost double the price.)
