### Introduction

The [VL6180X Time-of-Flight distance and ambient light sensor](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl6180x.html) uses infra-red lidar for estimating distances. It also contains an ambient light sensor.

[Integrated modules with the VL6180X](../../module/VL6180X/) are available from [Ddafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3316), [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14722) and [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/product/2489).
